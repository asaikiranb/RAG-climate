    {
      "question": "What are the differences between a heat pump and a traditional furnace?",
      "answer": "Heat pumps and traditional furnaces differ in several ways: 1) Heat pumps transfer heat rather than generate it, making them more efficient in moderate climates, 2) Furnaces burn fuel (gas/oil) to generate heat, while heat pumps use electricity to move heat, 3) Heat pumps can both heat and cool, while furnaces only heat, 4) Furnaces are more effective in very cold climates, 5) Heat pumps have lower operating costs but higher upfront costs, and 6) Heat pumps are more environmentally friendly.",

    {
      "question": "What is the SEER rating and why does it matter?",
      "answer": "SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) is a rating that measures the cooling efficiency of air conditioners and heat pumps. It represents the total cooling output during a typical cooling season divided by the total energy input. Higher SEER ratings indicate better efficiency. Modern systems must have a minimum SEER of 13-14, while high-efficiency units can reach SEER 20+. A higher SEER rating matters because it leads to lower energy bills, reduced environmental impact, and may qualify for rebates.",

      "question_type": "factual",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "reference": "SEER measures cooling efficiency - higher ratings mean better efficiency, lower energy costs, and reduced environmental impact. Minimum is 13-14, high-efficiency is 20+."

    {
      "question": "How do you calculate the required BTU capacity for a room?",
      "answer": "To calculate BTU capacity: 1) Measure the room's square footage (length × width), 2) Multiply square footage by 20 BTU for basic calculation, 3) Add 600 BTU per person if more than 2 people occupy the room regularly, 4) Add 4,000 BTU if the room has a kitchen, 5) Increase by 10% if the room is very sunny, decrease by 10% if heavily shaded, 6) For ceiling height over 8 feet, multiply the result by (ceiling height / 8). Example: 200 sq ft × 20 BTU = 4,000 BTU base capacity.",

      "question_type": "calculation",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "reference": "Multiply room square footage by 20 BTU, then adjust for occupancy (+600 per person), kitchen (+4000), sun exposure (±10%), and ceiling height."

      "question": "What are the main components of a central air conditioning system?",
      "answer": "The main components of a central air conditioning system are: 1) Compressor - compresses refrigerant and pumps it through the system, 2) Condenser coil - located in the outdoor unit, releases heat to the outside, 3) Evaporator coil - located in the indoor unit, absorbs heat from indoor air, 4) Air handler/Blower - circulates air through the ductwork, 5) Refrigerant lines - carry refrigerant between indoor and outdoor units, 6) Thermostat - controls system operation, 7) Air filter - removes particulates from air, and 8) Ductwork - distributes conditioned air throughout the building.",

    {
      "question": "How often should HVAC filters be changed and why?",
      "answer": "HVAC filter change frequency depends on several factors: 1) Standard 1-inch filters should be changed every 1-3 months, 2) 4-inch pleated filters can last 6-9 months, 3) Change more frequently (monthly) if you have pets, allergies, or live in dusty areas, 4) During heavy use seasons (summer/winter), change more often. Regular filter changes are important because they: maintain airflow efficiency, prevent system strain, improve indoor air quality, reduce energy costs, and prevent premature equipment failure.",

      "question_type": "how-to",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "reference": "Standard filters: 1-3 months, thick filters: 6-9 months, more often with pets/allergies. Regular changes maintain efficiency, air quality, and prevent equipment damage."
    },
    {
      "question": "What causes HVAC systems to freeze up and how can it be prevented?",
      "answer": "HVAC systems freeze up due to several reasons: 1) Restricted airflow from dirty filters or blocked vents, 2) Low refrigerant levels from leaks, 3) Dirty evaporator coils preventing heat absorption, 4) Malfunctioning blower fan, 5) Running the AC when outside temperature is below 60°F, 6) Closed or blocked return air vents. Prevention methods include: regularly changing filters, scheduling annual maintenance, keeping vents clear and open, maintaining adequate refrigerant levels, cleaning coils, and not running AC in cold weather.",

      "question": "Compare the advantages and disadvantages of ductless mini-split systems versus central HVAC systems.",
      "answer": "Ductless Mini-Split Advantages: 1) No ductwork needed (ideal for retrofits), 2) Zone-based control for better efficiency, 3) Easier installation, 4) Better for room additions, 5) No duct energy losses (30% savings potential). Disadvantages: 1) Higher upfront cost per unit, 2) Indoor units visible on walls, 3) Requires multiple units for whole-home coverage. Central HVAC Advantages: 1) Lower cost for whole-home coverage, 2) Units hidden in basement/attic, 3) Better for new construction, 4) Can integrate with whole-home air filtration. Disadvantages: 1) Requires ductwork installation, 2) Duct losses reduce efficiency, 3) Less flexible zoning, 4) Difficult to retrofit.",
